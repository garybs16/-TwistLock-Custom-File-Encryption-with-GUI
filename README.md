# üîí TwistLock ‚Äì Custom File Encryption with GUI

TwistLock is an **educational file encryption program** built in Python.  
It features a **custom reversible cipher**, **passphrase-based keying**, and both a **CLI** and **Tkinter GUI** interface for encrypting and decrypting files.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: TwistLock is not an industry-grade cipher. It was designed for learning purposes and should not be used to protect sensitive information.
